MSP_computer-keyboard
=====================

The project is inpsired by Zulko (on Github) http://zulko.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/typing-keyboard-python-musical-instrument/ and some of the code is also from his github project. The enhancement in my application is that users can play sounds with corresponding animation shown on the screen and record your play as a midi file if you want.

How to: 
1. Donwload this entire project.
2. Make sure you have installed Pygame in your machine.
3. move to the directory and $ python keyboard.py
4. enjoy it!
